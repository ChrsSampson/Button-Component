## About This Project
This application/site was created as a submission to a DevChallenges challenge. The challenge was to build an application to complete the given user stories.


Challenge: Create a reusable button with all the states in the design and a page displaying all the states. You can work on the same project with other design system challenges. Use Front-end libraries like React or Vue. Donâ€™t look at the existing solution. Fulfill user stories below:
<ul>
    <li>User story: I can see different button types: default, outline and text </li>
    <li>User story: I can choose to disable box-shadow </li>
    <li>User story: I can choose to disable the button </li>
    <li>User story: I can choose to have an icon on the left or right (Use Google Icon and at least 5 variants) </li>
    <li>User story: I can have different button sizes </li>
    <li>User story: I can have different colors </li>
    <li>User story: When I hover or focus, I can see visual indicators </li>
    <li>User story: I can still access all button attributes </li>
    <li>User story (optional): Show button in a similar way like the design or use Storybook.  Otherwise, showing the button in multiple states is enough </li>
